## üîç Key Features

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   - Analyzed and cleaned the dataset of 7,000+ books to prepare it for semantic search and classification.

2. **Semantic Embedding & Vector Search**  
   - Used OpenAI embeddings and LangChain's vector store for efficient semantic search of book content.

3. **Text Classification for Missing Categories**  
   - Applied **zero-shot classification** using the Hugging Face model `facebook/bart-large-mnli` to categorize books with missing genre metadata.

4. **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**  
   - Performed sentiment analysis on book descriptions using the `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base` model to classify emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, fear).

5. **Interactive Dashboard with Gradio**  
   - Created a Gradio app for users to search for books based on emotions, descriptions, or semantic similarity.
